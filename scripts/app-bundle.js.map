Some devices use WiFi, but that can be overkill for a device with only simple communication needs, not to mention providing another potential attack surface in your network. Other options include Bluetooth, and good old serial communications, or a combination of these options.   In this session, you'll learn about many of the available options for communicating between microcontroller-driven devices and PCs or internet-based services, including Microsoft Azure-based services. You'll see examples of reading sensor information and using a phone or PC to control devices remotely.
